Two options for testing:

1. Run LogIn.java directly for personal inputs. Read top of file for employee and admin access.

2. In order run AdminRegister.java, EmployeeRegister.java, RegisterTest.java, RegisterJointTest.java, EmployeeTest.java, DepositWithdrawTest.java, AdminTest.java.
	This will give the smoothest experience, though out of order will show what happens when proper data isn't present.
